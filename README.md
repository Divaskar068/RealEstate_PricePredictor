# REAL ESTATE PRICE PREDICTION 
Real estate price prediction is a crucial task in the real estate industry, as it helps buyers, sellers, and investors make informed decisions about property transactions. The importance of real estate price prediction lies in its ability to provide accurate pricing, informed buying, investment analysis, and market analysis.

Real estate price prediction is used by various stakeholders, including home buyers, home sellers, real estate agents, investors, and banks and lenders. Home buyers use price predictions to determine a fair price for a property, while home sellers use it to set a competitive price for their property. Real estate agents use price predictions to advise clients on market prices and identify opportunities, and investors use it to identify profitable investment opportunities. Banks and lenders also use price predictions to assess the value of properties for loan purposes.

Several websites currently use real estate price prediction, including Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com, and Homes.com. These websites use proprietary algorithms and machine learning models to estimate home values and provide price predictions.

The machine learning model used for real estate price prediction involves data collection, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. The data collection phase involves gathering data on various features of properties, such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, location, property type, age of the property, and amenities. The data preprocessing phase involves handling missing values, normalizing data, and one-hot encoding for categorical variables. The feature engineering phase involves extracting relevant features from the data, such as average price per square foot and distance to nearby amenities. The model selection phase involves choosing a suitable machine learning algorithm, such as linear regression, random forest, or support vector regression. The hyperparameter tuning phase involves using grid search CV to optimize hyperparameters for each algorithm.

Linear regression is a simple and widely used algorithm for real estate price prediction. It assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable (price). One-hot encoding is a technique used to convert categorical variables into numerical variables. For example, if we have a property type feature with three categories (single-family home, condo, townhouse), we can create three binary columns.

The machine learning model is deployed using Python Flask for the server, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. Python Flask is a lightweight web framework that provides a flexible and modular way to build web applications. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to create a user-friendly interface for users to input data and view price predictions.
